<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b><em>r.flip</em></b> - Flip a raster map along the vertical or
horizontal axis placed in the center of the computational region.
The default flip is North-South which swaps positions along the
horizontal axis. East-West flip can be done using
<b>-w</b> flag which swaps along the vertical axis.
A combined North-South and East-West flip can be done
using <b>-b</b> flag.

<p>
Region versus raster...

<p>
Diagonal flip...

<p>
NULL values???

<p>
Possible uses include in remote sensing for processing imagery data
where cells positions need to georeferenced (or corrected) manually.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Initial need for this module was for the import of
the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) images.
The original name was <em>i.flip</em>.
